== RoboCupJunior International 2025 General Rules

Please note, that regional, super-regional, and local tournaments may have
variations or adaptations to these rules to suit their specific
competition needs. It is important to check with the organizers of the
tournaments you are participating in to confirm which exact rules will
be in use.

If teams are unsure about any aspects of the General Rules or specific
League Rules, they are encouraged to inquire via the official
RoboCupJunior Forum for clarification: https://junior.forum.robocup.org/

=== Team requirements

==== Team Size
*Minimum Team Size*: Teams must consist of at least 2 members.

*Shared Members and Robots*: No team member(s) or robot(s) may be
shared between teams.

*Junior Mentor Requirement*: Each Junior team must have at least 
one Junior Mentor registered and attending with the team.

==== Age Requirements

*Junior Mentors and Parent/Chaperones:* Must be 19 years or older as
of the competition start date.

==== Team Members

*Entry Leagues*: RoboCupJunior Entry leagues and other "Primary"
divisions (where minimum age may vary) are not run at the international
competition but feature in many regions and SuperRegional tournaments.

*Technical Roles*: Every team member must have a defined technical
role (mechanical/design, electrical/sensing, software etc.) and should
be able to explain their role during technical judging.

=== Robot Requirements

==== Robot Communication

*Permitted Communication*: Communication between robots during
gameplay is allowed as long as it uses the 2.4GHz spectrum and its power
output does not exceed 100 mW EIRP under any circumstances.

*Responsibility*: Teams are responsible for managing their robot
communication. Spectrum availability is not guaranteed.

*Component Communication*: Communication between components of the
same robot is permitted.

==== Safety and Power Requirements

*Electrical Power*:

* Robots must not use mains electricity.

* Maximum allowed voltage: 48V DC or 25V AC RMS.

* Voltage must be easily measured during inspections, and measuring
points must be covered for safety or designed with safety considerations
in place.


*Battery Safety*:

* Lithium batteries must be stored in safety bags, and charging must be
supervised by team members in competition areas.

* Teams must follow safety protocols, including battery fire handling
and evacuation procedures.

*Robot Safety Design*:

* *Power Management*: Secure batteries, safe wiring, and emergency stop
functionality.

* *Mechanical Safety*: No sharp edges, pinch points, or other hazards.
Actuators must be appropriate for the robot’s size and function.

* *Hazardous Behavior*: Teams must report potentially dangerous robot
behaviors at least two weeks before the event.

=== Documentation and Sharing requirements

==== RCJ Team Posters

*Purpose*: Posters are a tool for sharing robot designs and insights
with judges, teams, and the public. Posters will be hung in public
competition areas in the venue and digital copies or photographs will be
shared by RCJ after the competition.

*Size*: Posters must be no larger than A1 size (60 x 84 cm).

*Content*: Posters should summarize design documents and present the
robot’s capabilities in an engaging format.


==== Sharing Team Resources

*Sharing*: Materials submitted by teams as part of the documentation
submission will be shared on GitHub repositories for the leagues:
https://github.com/robocup-junior

*Credit*: Teams must credit creators of external work and adhere to
licensing rules. The focus should remain on personal growth and
learning.

==== Plagiarism Guidelines

*External Code Use*: Teams are allowed to use external code but must
credit the original creators.

*Learning Priority*: Teams should prioritize learning and not use
complete solutions from others. Always pay attention to licensing rules.


=== Spirit and Behavior

==== Behavior

All participants are expected to behave themselves and be considerate and polite
especially but not only towards other participants, volunteers, referees and
organizers of all Junior and Major Leagues as well as the host venue.

==== Mentoring, Sponsorships and Component Reuse

Support from other teams, mentors, teachers, parents, sponsors, internet
communities etc. is a core part of how teams learn and grow. To ensure fair
competition and maximize learning it is required that none of the support they
receive does the work of competing for the team. A good indication is the team's
ability to explain not only what their robots' components do but also how they
do it.

==== Onsite help

Teams are only allowed to receive help from other teams during the competition.
To this end only student team members are allowed into the student work area
except with temporary organizer permission. Anyone else is forbidden from
touching the robots or their code, especially for repairs, changes, programming.

==== Violations

Teams that repeatedly conduct themselves in an unacceptable way may be
disqualified from the tournament and asked to leave the venue.
